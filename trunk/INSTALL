PerLex is an Alexina lexicon.

In order to install (an) Alexina lexicon(s), you need to install first a package called
alexina-tools, and the the lexicon(s) proper. The alexina-tools package and Alexina lexicons are
freely available (LGPL license or equivalent) as part of the alexina project on the INRIA GForge
(https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/alexina/). Some Alexina lexicons and the alexina-tools can be
retrieved as "packages" on the "Files" tab of the Alexina project
(https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=482).  All lexicons and the alexina-tools can be retrieved
from the subversion repository, following instructions provided under the "CVS/SVN" tab.

Starting from packages, you must install the alexina-tools before installing any lexicon. The
installation procedure is the standard one:
./configure
make
sudo make install
Note: the standard compilation procedure for each lexicon (e.g., PerLex) involves the use of
perlcc. If you don't have perlcc, or if you cannot or do not want to use it, add the
--enable-rawscripts option to the ./configure during the compilation of the lexicon.


Starting from subversion sources, the following commands must be launched:

1. for alexina-tools:
libtoolize (or glibtoolize, e.g., on a Mac)
aclocal
autoconf
automake -af
./configure
make
sudo make install

2. for each lexicon (e.g., Lefff or PerLex)
aclocal -I /usr/local/share/aclocal
autoconf
automake -af
./configure (optionaly with the optoin --enable-rawscript, see note above)
make
sudo make install
