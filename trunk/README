PerLex is the morphological and (soon) syntactic lexicon for the
Persian language developed in the context of the PerGram project
(funded by the French ANR and the German DFG, see
http://ed268.univ-paris3.fr/monde_iranien/ANR_PerGram/PerGram/Home_en.html)

It is currently in version 0.0.2. No manual validation is taken into
account in this version. The construction of this lexicon has involved
various sources, including the BijanKhan corpus (BijanKhan, 2004;
Amiri et al., 2007). The construction process is described in (Sagot &
Walther 2010a, 2010b). Lexical information from the freely-available
MULTEXT-East Persian lexicon has been partly included (QasemiZadeh and
Rahimi, 2006; Erjavec 2010).

The main contributors to this lexicon are, in alphabetical order,
Pegah Faghiri (MII, CNRS), Benoît Sagot (Alpage, INRIA), Pollet
Samvelian (MII, CNRS), Géraldine Walther (MII, CNRS). The copyright of
this lexicon is therefore owned jointly by INRIA and CNRS.

PerLex is distributed under the LGPL-LR license (see the LICENSE file).
